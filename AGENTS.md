# ProfileKit

Composable SVG card endpoints for GitHub profiles, READMEs, blogs, and personal
sites. Vanilla Node, no runtime dependencies, Vercel API routes plus Docker
self-hosting.

## Run this repo

```bash
npm run check
npm test
docker build -t profilekit:local .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 profilekit:local
```

## Structure

```
api/
  [endpoint].js  -> Vercel adapter dispatching named endpoints
src/
  endpoints/     -> endpoint handlers and response headers
  cards/         -> card renderers
  common/        -> shared SVG/query/theme helpers
server.js        -> local/self-host HTTP adapter
tests/           -> node:test coverage for endpoints and renderers
```

## Invariants

- ProfileKit is the only active project. The standalone MCP integration is
  retired; do not reintroduce its workspace, dependencies, or release workflows.
- Keep endpoints deterministic: same query string means same SVG.
- Treat every query parameter as untrusted input. Clamp numbers, whitelist
  enum-like strings, and escape text before embedding in SVG.
- Do not add user ranking, scoring, ratings, or analytics capture.
- Do not introduce a database or server-side persistence for card rendering.
- Docker and Vercel paths must stay behaviorally equivalent.
